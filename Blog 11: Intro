  The idea for my visual argument grew out of my passion for pursuing different hobbies and my understanding of activities and hobbies as being a great source of enrichment, skill-building, self-improvement, and creative expression.
I’ve met plenty of people, especially college students, who lack proper creative expression or a source of enrichment.
Having something to pursue adds value to your life and encourages you to learn skills! I am also aiming to deliver the message of not being afraid to try new things.
New hobbies or outlooks can seem daunting, but it’s important to start small with realistic expectations and allow yourself room to grow.
  I aimed to make my poster look fun, cluttered, and colorful to appeal to a younger audience and to push the idea of hobbies as being a bright, creative area to pursue.
I wanted the text, too, to look sort of rough and hand-made (I used the pen tool in Adobe Illustrator to write it out).
I figured this would be a sort of poster or flier, hence the busy appearance.
As for design fundamentals, I’m taking advantage of repetition, signal-to-noise ratio, and proximity.
There is a clear pattern in the type/coloring of my photos (repetition), I’m relying on photos more than text (signal-to-noise ratio), and I’m achieving my cluttered look by overlapping images and generally assuring they are close to one another (proximity).
