  I decided to rethink my visual argument after reading that the burnout idea was pretty popular!
Instead, I’m pivoting to an argument about something else I’m quite passionate about: hobbies.
I am a big proponent of hobbies as a method of enrichment, self-improvement, and creative expression.
They’re a great way to not only allow ourselves to unwind, but to also build new skills in the process.
For this visual argument, I’m specifically pushing for the viewer to “Never Stop Trying New Things”.
This is going to be a sort of inspirational poster with various hobbies (i.e., cooking, painting, yoga) plastered together in a magazine cut-out style.
I’m going to impose the text “Never Stop Trying New Things” over it, hand-drawn by myself to flow within the various images.
	My main audience is young people, like myself.
I’ve met a lot of college students and young working people who are drained and have no time to pursue their hobbies.
This lack of enrichment can have a major negative impact on their mental health.
My visual argument is going to remind them not only to pick up those hobbies, but to explore other options that may better fit their busy lifestyles.
I want the style of the poster to seem fun, inviting, and inspiring.
