During peer reviews, I got some fantastic feedback to implement into my visual argument.
To circle back to my last intro, my argument is a poster/flyer style graphic primarily targeting young people, specifically those struggling in school and work.
The poster is meant to convince these people to pick up something to provide them with a creative outlet, a skill-building tool, or a stress reliever.

I am a huge believer in pursuing hobbies and passion projects to counter the daily stresses of work, school, social activities, etc.
Whether it’s painting, cooking, gaming, hiking, or something else, my visual argument is telling my audience, “don’t let the stress and burnout overtake your life; make sure you do things for yourself, things that calm you, energize you, or make you feel grateful!”.
My peers recommended that I make this message clearer by adding pictures of people being burnt out, adding that this could be driven home by turning them black and white to contrast with the brightly-colored hobbies.
This turned out beautifully, and really emphasized my message when I was struggling to do so!
